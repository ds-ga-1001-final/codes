Hi all,

I will try to explain what all these files I uploaded are and how they can be used, I will upgrade this 'readme' file everytime I modified or add some new stuff to this repository

...
'sample_train_<size>.csv' : as you can possibly guess, these are the samples with <size> records, currently the problem of these dataset is the items in these files are picked up from only a small part of timespan (about 1 day), however, we could still use these data to built learning models. So let's try with these data first and I ll get better datasets for you in a couple of days.

Let's work on it!
